\begin{letter}{RoboCup Humanoid League Technical Committee}
\opening{Dear Sir or Madam:}
The NUbots team have participated in the RoboCup leagues every year since 2002, and are dedicated to continue our strong contributions to the robotics field.

The RoboCup Technical Committee can be assured that the NUbots team are committed and have secured funding to attend the RoboCup 2016 competition in Leipzig, Germany.

We also commit, as evident by our previous years of refereeing experience at RoboCup, to provide a person who has sufficient knowledge of the rules to referee throughout the competition.

Best regards, \\ Trent Houliston \\ NUbots Team Leader of 2016
